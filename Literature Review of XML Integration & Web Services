Goals	
A Systematic Literature Review of Student’ Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques	
The recent developments in the education sector have been significantly inspired by Educational Data Mining (EDM). The wide variety of research has discovered and enforced new possibilities and opportunities for technologically enhanced learning systems based on students’ needs. The EDM’s state-of-the-art methods and application techniques play a central role in advancing the learning environment	

Roles	
Modern learning institutions operate in a highly competitive and complex environment. Thus, analyzing performance, providing high-quality education, formulating strategies for evaluating the students’ performance, and identifying future needs are some challenges faced by most universities today.			

Audience	Your audience is an instructor, professionals software development and system integration.			

Situation	Students must independently find, analyze, and synthesize literature from credible sources to compare web services and XML integration in terms of their effectivess, best practices, and use cases.			

"Products/Performance/
Output"	A research paper, or comparative analysis report, or if you prefer a presentation-(provide the link for me to view it) synthesizing literature findings and providing well-supported evaluations.
